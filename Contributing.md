Submit an issue
===============
Discuss issue and see if feature, bug fix etc is needed.

Pull Release
============
If code work is needed then
 - create new branch (in form #issueX-some-light-desc)
 - first comment on PR should mention the issue by typing # followed by issue number. eg #5
 - close issue, further debate goes in PR
 - or you can use [hub](https://github.com/defunkt/hub) to automatically close issue and attach pr `hub pull-request -i 17` where `17` is the number of your issue (doesn't work for me)
